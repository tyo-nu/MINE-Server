   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to MINE-Server's documentation!
=======================================

All API Routes
--------------
To see source code for each route, see
`app.routes <https://github.com/tyo-nu/MINE-Server/blob/master/api/routes.py>`_
module.

In the spec below, if an argument is not present in the URL path, it should be
submitted as form data in POST request. If GET request, ignore arguments not in
URL path (they are incorrectly autogenerated by autoflask).

The following table lists all resources, along with their endpoints. Note that
for some resources, multiple endpoints exist (e.g. 'Exact structure search' has
4 endpoints). See routing table (link in upper right hand corner) for endpoints
ordered by path rather than resource.

For example usage, see this Jupyter Notebook at `the MINE-Server GitHub repo 
<https://github.com/tyo-nu/MINE-Server/blob/master/docs/API Examples.ipynb>`_.
