All API Routes
--------------
To see source code for each route, see app.routes module. If an argument is not
present in the URL path, it should be submitted as form data in POST request. If
get request, ignore arguments not in URL path (they are incorrectly autogenerated
by autoflask).

All API queries return `json_results`.
